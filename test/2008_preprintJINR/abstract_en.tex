Searching and reconstruction of the track in the drift chambers of the
STRELA setup. \\

Investigation of the drift chambers of the STRELA setup was performed in the
beam of the Nuclotron accelerator complex of the JINR Laboratory of High Energy
Physics. The descriptions of track-finding and reconstruction methods are
given. Using of drift chamber in experiment needs the correct determination
of the distance-to-drift time relation $r(t)$. This relation is auto calibrated
by an iterative procedure. Knowledge of the correct relation between the time
and space scales allows improving the accuracy of coordinate resolution of the
STRELA drift chambers. \\

The work was done in the Veksler and Baldin Laboratory of High Energy Physics
of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research.
